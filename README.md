# 🎬 MovieNightPicker  

**MovieNightPicker** is a personal SwiftUI app I built to solve a simple but annoying problem: I was spending more time searching for a movie than actually watching one. So I made an app that helps me quickly pick what to watch for my next movie night.  

## Features

- **Random movie generator** – get one great suggestion instantly  
- **Filter by genre** – choose exactly what mood you’re in  
- **Filter by streaming platform** – see what’s available where you watch  
- **Browse movies** – scroll through trending and popular titles  
- **Save movies** – mark as *watched* or add to your *watchlist*  
- **Search movies** *(not implemented yet)* – find specific titles fast
